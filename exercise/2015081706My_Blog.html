              Unemployed young people will be ordered to attend three-week “boot camps” to help them to get back into work, under government plans to be announced today. The compulsory programmes, which will take place in jobcentre classrooms throughout the country, are designed to put people aged between 18 and 21 “through their paces” to find work or training within half a year. From April 2017, when the scheme is to be introduced, under-21s will lose all benefits after being unemployed for six months. They will be ordered to attend the classes in the first three weeks of claiming out-of-work payments. The 71 hours of training will be built around an “intensive curriculum”…
